Source Code for UNR's CS 481 class utilizing AI Pathfinding for ship movement.
NOTE - Code requires Unity asset implementation for functionality.
For demonstration of code, please contact the author.

Video demos are available alongside the source code.

## Summary
The code is based around a navy simulation program for UNR's Graduate-Level Advanced Game Design class for fall 2023,
which utilizes A* waypoint navigation with potential fields. Navigation modes can be switched through the menu interface,
along with setting randomly generated obstacles through the scene. Video demos of these features are available in repo.
